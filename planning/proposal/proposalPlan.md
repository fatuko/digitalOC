Proposal format:
Proposals should be around 1 page:
½ page of the overall vision
¼ page of semester specific goals
2-3 Milestones per student
Every milestone should have a nominal completion date
Dates can be something like:
Week 2
End of October
Mid-semester,
Etc.
Vision:
DigitalOC aims to revolutionize offensive play calling in American football by transforming a vast database of historical play-by-play data into optimal, data-driven, play call suggestions. 
Football is an immensely complex game where Offensive Coordinators are in a constant chess match trying to make the most optimal play calls given an insurmountable amount of variables. What if we could lean away from intuition based calls that the human mind is limited to and bank on the computers ability to process millions of data points in seconds? 
This is where DigitalOC comes in. A machine learning model designed to analyze an immense amount of nfl play-by-play data and suggest a list of the most optimal play calls ranked by expected yards gained.
data gathering and processing
data classification
Determining play success/failure
Determining a way to categorize data
installing development environment

Determining expected value / estimated points added for any play

Python libraries:
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib?


-Deciding a model for best predications
-Fine tuning the model


Data engineering:
Build structured dataset
Clean inconsistent/missing data
Cross validating using historical plays/past data
Establish all variables that affect play call
Situational analysis



Daniel: 
Data analysis and data mining
Getting hands-on experience with W/SciKit and TensorFlow
Writing a non-code report detailing what the data actually means.
Define a hard set of parameters (i.e, down, distance, field side, etc) and use it in addition to the play-by-play data

Russell:
Installing ML libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow
Finding playcalling data online
Gather data like: Qtr, Score, Down&Distance, Distance to end zone, current player stats
Migrate data to database (?)

Nicole:
Designing data schema (how will situations be represented)/Build structured dataset
Clean inconsistent/missing data
Cross validating using historical plays/past data
Benchmark against existing tools

Gavin:
Preprocess nfl database of plays
Develop basic algorithm to predict optimal plays
Basic web app/ interface?
