DigitalOC
September 19th, 2025

Overview
DigitalOC aims to revolutionize offensive play-calling in American football by transforming a vast database of historical play-by-play data into optimal, data-driven, playcall suggestions.
Football is an immensely complex game where Offensive Coordinators are in a constant chess match trying to make the most optimal playcalls given an insurmountable amount of variables. 

What if we could lean away from intuition based calls that the human mind is limited to and bank on the computers ability to process millions of data points in seconds?

This is where DigitalOC comes in. A machine learning model designed to analyze an immense amount of NFL play-by-play data and suggest a list of the most optimal playcalls ranked by expected yards gained.

Semester Goals
By the end of this semester, we will have constructed a baseline model that is capable of providing accurate recommendations for a variety of in-game situations. This will involve data acquisition, feature engineering, and rigorous model training and evaluation. After this baseline model has been made, a basic web app for visualizing this model will be created to serve as a user-friendly interface for the model, allowing for the model to show off its functionality and value.


Milestones
End of September
Establish a standardized project environment by defining and installing all necessary Python libraries
Gather all raw NFL play-by-play data that is necessary
Data cleaning and preprocessing will be done to prepare the raw data for model training
Middle of October
A comprehensive, clean, and structured database will be completed for all project data
Feature engineering will begin, transforming raw data into meaningful and predictive variables
End of October
Begin the model exploration phase, including the selection and training of various machine learning algorithms
Middle of November
A basic web application will be developed to visualize the model’s predictions and provide a user interface
End of Semester
Final hyperparameter tuning will be conducted to optimize our chosen model’s performance
